# SaltyRN Decision Ledger

Last updated: 2026-07-14 (Asia/Seoul)

Statuses are `Accepted`, `Proposed`, or `Superseded`. Accepted decisions are the
working defaults until a later dated entry explicitly supersedes them.

## D-001: Proof Claim Ladder

**Status:** Accepted, 2026-07-12.

Keep Lean typechecking, Lean-model equivalence, C-to-Lean correspondence, C-source
observational equivalence, and machine-code correctness as separate claims. The
current project targets C-source observational equivalence; machine code is a later
optional bridge.

## D-002: Integer-First Development

**Status:** Accepted, 2026-07-12.

Defer Float32 denotation and FP kernel proofs. Preserve integer/FP/mask type tags,
exact intrinsic identity, extensible architecture/effect state, byte memory,
observation parameters, and full build provenance. While the integer feature set is
active, every reachable FP type, cast, operation, or contraction fails closed.

## D-003: Three-Part Generated Artifact

**Status:** Accepted, 2026-07-12.

Every supported kernel must produce:

```text
ArtifactEnvelope  build command, hashes, ranges, target/ABI, coverage
KernelIR          typed program, memory effects, intrinsic nodes, schedule
Contract/Observe  valid states, UB boundary, outputs and state projection
```

The emitter generates data, not arbitrary theorem bodies. Lean owns the reviewed
denotation and theorem combinators.

## D-004: Initial Verification Defaults

**Status:** Accepted as working defaults, 2026-07-12.

- Quantify over every legal RVV VLEN/`vl` schedule, rather than only VLEN=128.
- Observe the written output prefix and require a frame property; quotient away
  unobserved architectural status in the first slice.
- Permit disjoint input/output buffers or exact in-place execution, not arbitrary
  partial overlap.
- Initially trust a pinned Clang typed AST, but require fail-closed extraction,
  complete body coverage, deterministic regeneration, and a checked manifest.
- Bind the real translation unit, headers, defines, flags, target triple, ABI, and
  source/dependency hashes. A synthetic facade is not final authority.
- Fix little-endian execution initially and avoid implementation-defined signed
  narrowing through representability preconditions.

## D-005: First Paired Vertical Slice

**Status:** Accepted, 2026-07-12.

Use current-main `s8-vclamp`: both Neon source and RVV target exist. The initial
contract is `batch > 0`, `-128 <= min <= max <= 127`, input readable through
`roundUp(batch, 8)`, output writable through `batch`, and disjoint or exact in-place
buffers. Prove memory safety, termination, exact footprint/frame, refinement of both
sides to signed clamp, and final observational equivalence.

## D-006: Proof-Agent Boundary

**Status:** Accepted, 2026-07-12.

An agent may synthesize theorem bodies and supporting lemmas. It may not weaken or
edit semantic definitions, contracts, observation relations, theorem headers, source
binding, or the allowed-axiom policy merely to make a proof pass.

## D-007: Layered Translation Acceptance

**Status:** Accepted, 2026-07-12.

Keep three checks distinct: an envelope may report complete AST auditing; an emitter
may claim that coverage entries were translated; only a concrete relation against a
reference-shape-checked `KernelIR` may establish structural coverage binding. Translation
references are typed as parameter, operation, or block references and are checked in
both directions. A reviewed operation-descriptor registry, not extractor-supplied
family tags, fixes each supported spelling's architecture, type signature, and RVV
SEW/LMUL shape.
This still does not prove semantic preservation. Registry version/provenance and a
validated lowering bridge are required before the result becomes authoritative.

## D-008: Generated-Spec Trust Boundary

**Status:** Accepted, 2026-07-14.

Automatically generate source/target IR data, checked lowering certificates, and a
fixed observational-equivalence theorem obligation. A generated architecture-neutral
normal form may be used as a proof witness, but not presented as an independent API
specification. Contracts, observations, intrinsic denotations, and allowed axioms
remain reviewed/versioned inputs. Direct source-IR/target-IR equivalence is primary.

## D-009: Supported Mutations Lower to Different IR

**Status:** Accepted, 2026-07-14.

The frontend rejects unknown syntax, types, casts, and calls, but it must not reject a
supported intrinsic mutation merely because it no longer implements the expected
theorem. Such a mutation produces different typed IR; Lean execution/proof must then
fail or expose a counterexample. Answer-shaped extractor validation remains useful only
as an audit oracle, not as the production translator.

## D-010: Positive Progress Is Not ISA Legality

**Status:** Accepted, 2026-07-14.

Call the current RVV quantification a `PositivePartition` or positive progress model.
Do not call every such partition an ISA-legal `vsetvl` trace. A later bridge must fix
VLEN/VLMAX/SEW/LMUL and prove that concrete `vsetvl` execution yields a member of the
verified progress set.
